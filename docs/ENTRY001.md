# A Shadowed Reflection

long have I called, long have I suffered and pled, begged, for your reality to be kind and nice

I weathered storms in my mind, bruised and battered, my vessel weary till broken, a soul suffering in demise

How loud your cries of war to the echoing <mark>chambers of my mind</mark>-- I only sought for peace amidst the peering eyes..

I need nothing material, nothing ephemeral, life and its glory, the winds that caress me are my joy eternal

You shatter me easily with your rage uncontrolled, deny.. deny.. deny.. a thief shameful of her own mind

I no longer care~ I no longer wait for justice, I only yearn to be free of this torment you ever so justify...

In a blur, reality has changed right before my eyes, do you find satisfaction in this never ending atrophy?

Why must you be the one for me? Does my life have no meaning? Is my wellbeing imaginary?

You have no idea how many times I ask <mark>God why this tribulation</mark> has befell me

Why must I have a peek at wellness, only to be sunken down in the depths of the abyss

I've climbed many mountains, but this time, I think I can no longer conquer a hill

I've lost myself... trying to set you free, make you see, make you breathe...

I am but a husk now, a reflection of thee. I've lost my music with your load toxicity...

You've once confided you found satisfaction in being a puppeteer,

I cut my strings, <mark>for the price of freedom</mark>, lifeless I shall be...

My daughter is the only light now in this jaded vision I see

The only gasoline keeping me going.. steady...

A fool I am, for the match was yours alight me, <mark>its a dream</mark>, I'm shackled still.

You hold the key.

My last moments~ Professional~ wear a suit and put the tie around my neck...

at least I rest eternally with the warmth of the light that made me.

```java
When darkness calls for me, from nothing I was.. unto nothing I'll be-
what's the purpose of trying to be somebody?
If you break today, would you know the remedy?
They say pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses understanding.
A bitter potion by which you heal your sick self.
However, there is no cure- we are only prolonging the inevitablity..
How do you rise when decay grips you deep?
-- you let it take you and embrace you for that is which love is --
