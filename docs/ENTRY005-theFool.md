# A fool's paradigm
Here I go again, they beseech me, they yell--
"Don't do it!", they say...
Much like the first time, I never listened, I strayed...
Cries of care sound the war song, I've gambled it again...
Taking a bet has never cost me anything,
"What a lie! You just can't help yourself,"
as my other selves mockingly taunt the choice of my decided fate.

"Again, you'd betray!?" another voice inside me joins the protesting
revolution of my soul's array.
*"How many gems have you lost!? People still believe in you—*scoffs
yet you throw it all away."
I reach through my nerves as a thought lingers to me, the one in control—
"Surely the warmth we've felt wasn't a fake."
Laughter echoes in the chamber of my dome.
"Thou shalt not regret when we lay upon thee the blame."
I shake off the voices, as I open my eyes awake—
"She sees me, she hears, the walls will fall, just you wait."

Yet a new light has emerged.
In a soft tone, he says:
"Till when must ye roll the dice? Cruel is fate, you'd no less play your hand to gold; it always falls to your grave."
I fall to my knees, tears in my eyes, I look up:
"Why such a tribulation ordained?"

Silence ensues, till the light mutters:
"You have only a few left; are you sure you'd willingly give it away?"
The face contorts—I'd give myself for her... a gambler's dilemma, all or nothing,
as the others hope to pray.

"Do I let us fall?" I ask in humble wait.
"Be still, I, be like water; let it flow, let it wave."
The voices shush, as an enlightenment reintroduces itself in my brain.
A trial this heavy must float, you need not carry this weight.
