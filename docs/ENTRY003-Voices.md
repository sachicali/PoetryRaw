Would you listen if you knew how much I hurt myself for what I've said and have done?

Would you be nice, if you knew how fragile I was before all of this?

Would you give me peace, if you knew how much I was carrying?

Would you consider me, if you knew how much I wasn't seen?

Would you provide me cure if you knew your toxins ail me?

Would you give me light, if you knew how dark it was where I've been?

Would you lift me up, if you knew how sunken I fell?
