I can't believe I still fucking love you after everything we went through
after every fucking thing you did to my mind, my soul, and my view
I can't help but put you on my mind, I pleasure myself to the thought of us two
And I hate you for what this relationship has became, I can't fucking believe I'm still in love with you.
Maybe I am the hopeless romantic, I don't give a fuck.

I really only wanna get away from this deep darky feeling cos its shite
I am so sick and tired of this. Im sorry, you're at peace now and that's good.
I ain't fighting with you, I'm just frying in the pan and I want this to stop.
You're not doing anything, I know, I want whatevers inside me to stop

You want to know why I always ask you if we can finally settle the annulment?
It's so I can control this and finally put a stop to this ridicule
I role play and think how it'd be if you just treated me good, If I behave differently, if we were a healthy family
Not recently, that was mine, I meant ages ago when it was due

I need you to see other people, I need both of us to see other people
it's the only way this fucking feeling can die and we forget whatever this trauma was.
Only when reality has settled will this be finally at peace. You dont owe it to me but It'd be great if you helped too.
Its getting stupid at this point I'm wishing ppl in reddit who have any resemblance of you and your actions well and cheering them on.

Let's just please get some closure, let's settle this like adults instead of ignoring when communicating without any blametossing is asked and required.
Let me see my daughter. Let me be over this once and for all. I need this to stop.
The mere image of you in Malaysia provoked many memories and I need them to stop.
Please I'm not asking you as a friend or as an ex-husband, I'm asking you as Sachi's father and as a human. Let's finally put an end to this please. I hate it without clarity, you always do things blurry and jaded. Please let's end this like adults.

If you're at peace to move on, know I absolutely love that and would want nothing else than this relationship to end. 
I just need a prologue without leaving loose ends. To clarify, I am not begging for the relationship to be back nor am I wanting this relationship back. 
We need to personally talk and end this like adults. 
Things like this, you do personally, its not just something you can send a message to someone about, not just something you can ghost & ignore about. 

Just be real with me one last moment and lets end this please.
